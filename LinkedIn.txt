day-8-non-repeating-letter
============================


Today I solved day 8 of the 2025 AdventJS coding challenge 👨🏽‍💻



https://adventjs.dev/challenges/2025/8



The Challenge

==========



Return the first non-repeating letter (regardless of casing) in a string. If all letters are repeated, return an empty string. for example:



-  "Gift" should return "G"

-  "sS" should return ""

-  "reindeeR" should return "i"



TypeScript Solution

=============



1. Use a dictionary (JS Object {})

2. Iterate over the entire string and mark if the lowercase letter occurred before. 



We have to run the entire string, because the first non-repeating letter could be the last e.g. "aaaaaaaaaaaab"



3. Do the final pass, reference the dictionary, and break out of the function at the first letter that has no duplicate appearances.



Complexities

=========



- Time complexity is O(n) assuming dictionary insertion and retrieval is O(1).

- Space complexity is O(n) as O(1) for the dictionary itself (fixed alphabet size), and O(n) for the extra array allocation.

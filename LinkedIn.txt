Today I solved day 8 of the 2025 AdventJS coding challenge:

https://adventjs.dev/challenges/2025/8

The challenge is to return the first non-repeating letter (regardless of casing) in a string. If all letters are repeated, return an empty string. For example:

-   "Gift" should return "G"
-   "sS" should return ""
-   "reindeeR" should return "i"

Overall a straightforward problem, and my TypeScript solution is to:

1.  Use a dictionary (JS Object {})
2.  Iterate over the entire string and mark if the lowercase letter occurred before. 

We have to run the entire length of the string, because the first non-repeating letter could be the last e.g. "aaaaaaaaaaaab"

3.  Do another pass, and break out of the function at the first letter that has no duplicate appearances.

- Time complexity is O(n) assuming dictionary insertion and retrieval is O(1).
- Space complexity is O(n) as O(1) for the dictionary itself, and O(n) for the extra array allocation.
